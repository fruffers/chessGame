# chessGame
2D GUI chess game Python using Tkinter and PIL, event driven, OOP
<br />
<br />
IF YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY THE PURE GAME THEN DOWNLOAD THE 'DIST' FOLDER AND RUN THE EXE FILE. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD 'MATS' FOLDER WITH THE EXE AND KEEP THEM IN THE SAME FOLDER (OR PUT MATS INSIDE DIST) OTHERWISE THE GAME WILL NOT WORK.
<br />
Or if you want to run the game in Python make sure you have PIL (pillow) and Tkinter modules.
